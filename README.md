## 🌌 The Story

After being betrayed and banished by the royal family, **Ace** has only one goal—**destroy everything**. He must conquer 8 royal planets, each guarded by powerful enemies and secrets of the kingdom, to reach the final palace.

But there's a twist:  
If **Ace** dies, **everything resets**.

This core mechanic, called **Regen**, ensures every defeat restarts the journey. No checkpoints. No mercy.
